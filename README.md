# Linux-Tools
This repository contains a list of bash scripts I've created and updated over the years. The aim was to speed up common tasks, or allow for them to
run as scheduled tasks when required.

Contained within this repository is a number of scripts for DEB and RPM based distributions. A quick summary of the scripts included are tools to update, upgrade
and auto clean when completed. Others install and enable software such as MariaDB, Dockers, Jenkins and Apache2.

# Notes
  Additional updates and scripts will be developed and provided continuously, as my needs change, and they've been determined to be useful to others. Please be 
  advised, you run these scripts at your own risk, so check them out before you try them. Most or all scripts may need to be run as root or under sudo.
