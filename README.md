# Linux-Tools
Contained within this repository, is a number of scripts for deb and rpm based systems. Some of the scripts including auto updating and upgrading of applications and operating systems, before removing any unnecessary files. Others include downloading, installing and configuring some software applications, such as Jenkins.

# Notes
  Additional updates and scripts will be coming soon, as I think of things that would be useful for any system admin.
  Please be advised, you run these scripts at your own risk, so check them out before you try them.
  Most or all scripts may need to be run as root or under sudo.
